File 7 contains Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors. I used try and except for my program. Where in try i wrote the code and further in except if the file not found error occurs i would print the following statement.In code i opened the file named 'sample.txt' in read mode using var and then used two more var for the line 1 and line 2. then closed the file and usinf print I got the output.
File 8 contains Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File. In my program i first asked for user input as a text and using append i added them to an empty file named 'output.txt', and then printed a statement saying data successfully written to output.txt. Then i asked for another additional text from user and similarly added it too, printing data successfully appended. At last i used printed the statement 'Final content of output.txt:' and opened the file again in read mode and displayed the result. i have uploaded the output file after running the code once using the text in output asked in the assignment.
